# Portfolio

Welcome to my developer portfolio! This repository showcases some of my projects and contributions in the field of development.

## Technologies Used

This portfolio is built using Vue 3 and Vite, providing a fast and efficient development environment. It's structured to be easily customizable and scalable.

## Recommended IDE Setup

For the best development experience, I recommend using:

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): A powerful and customizable code editor.
- [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar): An extension specifically designed for Vue 3 development.
- [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin): Enhances TypeScript support for Vue projects.

Please disable Vetur if you have it installed, as Volar provides all the necessary features for Vue 3 development.

## Customize Configuration

To customize the configuration of this project, refer to the [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/). Vite offers a flexible and easy-to-understand configuration setup, allowing you to tailor the build process to your specific needs.

## Project Setup

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies by running the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

### Development Mode

During development, you can utilize hot-reloading for instant feedback. Run the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This command compiles the project and sets up a development server with hot-reloading enabled. Any changes you make to the source code will be reflected immediately in the browser.

### Production Build

When you're ready to deploy your portfolio, you'll need to generate a production build. Run the following command:

```sh
npm run build
```

This command compiles and minifies your project files, optimizing them for production. The resulting build artifacts can be deployed to a web server for public access.
